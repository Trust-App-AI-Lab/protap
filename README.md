# prot_learn
prot_learn is a PyTorch-based machine learning toolbox designed for protein analysis.

**This repository is only a development repository, not a release version. Feel free to make modifications and submit issues.**

I provided a case in the models, with a method called KDBNet, from [*Calibrated geometric deep learning improves kinaseâ€“drug binding predictions*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-023-00751-0), published in Nat. Mach. Intell.
